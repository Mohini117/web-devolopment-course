    <h2> # Begining of code</h2>
    <b> In 2022, I embarked on my tech journey by delving into Python through Code with Harry tutorials. This engaging experience opened the doors to the vast world of programming, setting the foundation for my passion and exploration in the tech realm.</b><br>
    <p> This is me executing my first calculator using coding and really feeling like a programmer, its lot of fun at that time as well as now too while doing coding or programming </p>

    <h2> # Towards excellence</h2>
    <p> I recently had the privilege of completing a challenging course at Harvard University, which has significantly enriched my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. This rigorous program, known as CS50 CodeSpace, encompassed a comprehensive curriculum consisting of 10 complex problem-solving exercises and culminated in a substantial project. This project, now hosted on my GitHub repository, represents a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a proficient programmer.<br><br>

    My journey with CS50 CodeSpace has been nothing short of transformative. The course provided me with a deep understanding of various programming concepts, with a primary focus on Python. Python, being a versatile and widely-used language, has become my forte, and this course allowed me to delve into its intricacies and applications extensively.<br><br>
        
    Completing this course is not merely an academic achievement; it marks a pivotal moment in my personal and professional development. It has equipped me with the tools and knowledge necessary to contribute effectively to open-source projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the global coding community. My passion for programming and the skills honed at Harvard have ignited a desire within me to take on ambitious projects and pursue my aspirations.<br><br>
        
    This accomplishment is more than just a certificate; it represents my dedication to self-improvement and the pursuit of excellence. With this newfound expertise, I am confident in my ability to tackle more complex challenges, explore innovative solutions, and ultimately lead myself toward the career path I have envisioned. I am excited to continue learning and growing, eager to make meaningful contributions to the world of computer science, and determined to achieve my goals.</p>
